# Introduction

Let's first start with a brief introduction of the SDMX information model.

In order to make sense of some statistical data, we need to know the concepts
associated with them. For example, on its own the figure 1.2953 is pretty meaningless,
but if we know that this is an exchange rate for the US dollar against the euro on
23 November 2006, it starts making more sense.

There are two types of concepts: dimensions and attributes. Dimensions, when combined,
allow to uniquely identify statistical data. Attributes on the other hand do not help
identifying statistical data, but they add useful information (like the unit of measure
or the number of decimals). Dimensions and attributes are known as "components".

The measurement of some phenomenon (e.g. the figure 1.2953 mentioned above) is known as an
"observation" in SDMX. Observations are grouped together into a "data set". However, there
can also be an intermediate grouping. For example, all exchange rates for the US dollar
against the euro can be measured on a daily basis and these measures can then be
grouped together, in a so-called "time series". Similarly, you can group a collection of
observations made at the same point in time, in a "cross-section" (for example,
the values of the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc against the euro at a
particular date). Of course, these intermediate groupings are entirely optional and you
may simply decide to have a flat list of observations in your data set.

The SDMX information model is much richer than this limited introduction,
however the above should be sufficient to understand the sdmx-json format. For
additional information, please refer to the [SDMX documentation](http://sdmx.org/?page_id=10).

Samples, tools and other SDMX-JSON resources are available in the public Github
repository <https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-prototype-json/tree/master/draft-sdmx-json>.

Before we start, let's clarify a few more things about this guide:

-  New fields may be introduced in later versions. Therefore
consuming applications should tolerate the addition of new fields with ease.
- The ordering of fields in objects is undefined. The fields may appear in any order
and consuming applications should not rely on any specific ordering. It is safe to consider a
nulled field and the absence of a field as the same thing.
- Not all fields appear in all contexts. For example response with error messages
may not contain fields for data, dimensions and attributes.

# Field Guide to SDMX-JSON Objects

## Message

Message is the top level object and it contains the data as well as the metadata needed to interpret those data.
Example:

    {
      "header": {
          # header fields #
      },
      "structure": {
          # structure objects #
      },
      "dataSets": [
          # data set objects #
      ],
      "errors": [
          # Error messages #
      ]
    }

### header

*Object* *nullable*. *[Header](#Header)* contains basic technical information about
the message, such as when it was prepared and how has sent it. Example:

    "header": {
      "id": "b1804c51-1ee3-45a9-bb75-795cd4e06489",
      "prepared": "2012-05-04T03:30:00"
    }

### structure

*Object* *nullable*. *[Structure](#Structure)* contains the information needed to
interpret the data available in the message, such as the list of concepts used. Example:

    "structure": {
        "uri": "http://sdw-ws.ecb.europa.eu/dataflow/ECB/EXR/1.0",
        "dimensions": {
            # dimensions object #
        },
        "attributes": {
            # attributes object #
        }
        "annotations": [
            # annotation objects #
        ]
    }

### dataSets

*Array* *nullable*. *DataSets* field is an array of *[DataSet](#DataSet)* objects. That's where the data (i.e.: the observations)
will be. Example:

    "dataSets": [
      {
        "action": "Information",
        "observations": {
            # observation objects #
        }
      }
    ]

In typical cases, the file will contain only one data set. However, in some cases, such as when retrieving,
from an SDMX 2.1 web service, what has changed in the data source since in particular point in time, the web
service might return more than one data set.

### errors

*Array* *nullable*. RESTful web services indicates errors using the HTTP status
codes. In addition, whenever appropriate, the error messages can also be returned using
this error field. Error is an array of error messages. Example:

    "errors": [
      {
        "code": 150,
        "message": "Invalid number of dimensions in the key parameter"
      }
    ]

#### code

*number*. Provides a code number for the error message. Code numbers are defined
in the SDMX 2.1 Web Services Guidelines. Example:

    "code": 150

#### message

*string*. Provides the error message. Example:

    "message": "Invalid number of dimensions in the key parameter"

## header

Header contains basic information about the message, such as when it was prepared and
who has sent it. Example:

    "header": {
      "id": "b1804c51-1ee3-45a9-bb75-795cd4e06489",
      "prepared": "2013-01-03T12:54:12",
      "sender: {
        "id": "SDMX"
      }
    }

### id

*String*. Unique string that identifies the message for further references.
Example:

    "id": "TEC00034"

### test

*Boolean* *nullable*. Indicates whether the message is for test purposes or not. False for normal messages. Example:

    "test": false

### prepared

*String*. A timestamp indicating when the message was prepared. Values must
follow the ISO 8601 syntax for combined dates and times, including time zone. Example:

    "prepared": "2012-05-04T03:30:00Z"

### sender

*Object*. Information about the party that is transmitting the message. Sender contains the following fields:

* id - *String*. A unique identifier of the party.
* name - *String* *nullable*. A human-readable name of the sender.
* contact - *Array* *nullable*. A collection of contact details.

Example:

    "sender": {
      "id": "ECB",
      "name": "European Central Bank"
      "contact": [
        # contact details #
      ]
    }

#### contact

*Array* *nullable*. Information on how the party can be contacted.

Each object in the collection may contain the following field:
* name - *String*. The contact's name.
* department - *String* *nullable*. The organisational structure for the contact.
* role - *String* *nullable*. The responsibility of the contact.
* telephone - *Array* *nullable*. An array of telephone numbers for the contact.
* fax - *Array* *nullable*. An array of fax numbers for the contact person.
* uri - *Array* *nullable*. An array of uris. Each uri holds an information URL for the contact.
* email - *Array* *nullable*. An array of email addresses for the contact person.

Example:

    "contact": [
        {
            "name": "Statistics hotline",
            "email": [ "statistics@xyz.org" ]
        }
    ]

### receiver

*Object* *nullable*. Information about the party that is receiving the message. This can be
useful if the WS requires authentication. Receiver contains the same fields as sender (see above):

Example:

    "receiver": {
      "id": "SDMX"
    }



## structure

*Object* *nullable*. Provides the structural metadata necessary to interpret the data contained in the message.
It tells you which are the components (dimensions and attributes) used in the message and also describes to which
level in the hierarchy (data set, series, observations) these components are attached.

Example:

    "structure": {
        "uri": "http://sdw-ws.ecb.europa.eu/dataflow/ECB/EXR/1.0",
        "dimensions": {
            # dimensions object #
        },
        "attributes": {
            # attributes object #
        },
        "annotations": {
            # annotations object #
        }
    }

### uri

*String* *nullable*. A link to an SDMX 2.1 web service resource where additional information regarding the structure is
available (e.g.: link to the dataflow). Example:

    "uri": "http://sdw-ws.ecb.europa.eu/dataflow/ECB/EXR/1.0"

### name

*String* *nullable*. Data flow name. Example:

    "name": "Sample dataflow"

### description

*String* *nullable*. Descriptio of the data flow. Example:

    "description": "Data flow description."

### dimensions

*Object*. Describes the dimensions used in the message as well as the levels in the hierarchy (data set, series,
observations) to which these dimensions are attached. Example:

    "dimensions": {
        "dataSet": [
            # Component objects #
        ],
        "series": [
            # Component objects #
        ],
        "observation": [
            # Component object #
        ]
    }

### attributes

*Object*. Describes the attributes used in the message as well as the levels in the hierarchy (data set, series,
observations) to which these attributes are attached. Example:

    "attributes": {
        "dataSet": [
            # Component objects #
        ],
        "series": [
            # Component objects #
        ],
        "observation": [
            # Component objects #
        ]
    }
    
### dataSet
*Array* *nullable*. Optional array to be provided if components (dimensions or attributes) are attached to the data set level.

### series
*Array* *nullable*. Optional array to be provided if components (dimensions or attributes) are attached to the series level.

### observation
*Array* *nullable*. Optional array to be provided if components (dimensions or attributes) are attached to the observation level.

#### component

A component represents a dimension or an attribute used in the message. It contains basic information about the component
(such as its name and id) as well as the list of values used in the message for this particular component. Example:

    {
      "id": "FREQ",
      "name": "Frequency",
      "keyPosition": 0,
      "values": [
        {
          # value object #
        }
      ]
    }

Each of the components may contain the following fields

##### id

*String*. Identifier for the component.
Example:

    "id": "FREQ"

##### name

*String*. Name provides a human-readable name for the component.
Example:

    "name": "Frequency"

##### description

*String* *nullable*. Provides a description for the component. Example:

    "description": "The time interval at which observations occur over a given time period."

##### keyPosition

*Number* *nullable*. Indicates the position of the dimension in the key, starting at 0.
This field should not be supplied for attributes and it may also be omitted for dimensions. This field could be used to build the "key" parameter string (i.e. D.USD.EUR.SP00.A) for data queries, whenever the order of the dimensions cannot easily be derived from the structural metadata information available in the data message. Example:

    "keyPosition": 0

##### role

*String* *nullable*. Defines the component role(s), if any. Roles are represented by the id of a concept defined as [SDMX cross-domain concept](http://sdmx.org/?page_id=11). Several of the concepts defined as SDMX cross-domain concepts are useful for data visualisation, such as for example, the series title, the unit of measure, the number of decimals to be displayed, the reference area (e.g. when using maps), the period of time to which the measured observation refers, etc. It is recommended to identify any component that can be useful for data visualisation purposes by using the appropriate SDMX cross-domain concept as role.

Example:

    "role": "TITLE"

##### default

*String* or *Number* *nullable*. Defines a default value for the component (valid for attributes only!). If
no value is provided in the data part of the message then this value applies. Example:

    "default": "A"

##### values

*Array*. Array of [values](#component_values) for the component. Example:

    "values": [
      {
        "id": "M",
        "name": "Monthly"
      }
    ]

##### Component value

*Object* *nullable*. A particular value for a component in a message. Example:

    {
        "id": "M",
        "name": "Monthly"
    }

###### id

*String*. Unique identifier for a value. Example:

    "id": "A"

###### name

*String*. Human-readable name for a value. Example:

    "name": "Missing value; data cannot exist"

###### description

*String* *nullable*. Description provides a human-readable description of the value. The description is typically longer
than the text provided for the name field. Example:

    "description": "Description for missing value."

###### start and end fields

*String* *nullable*. Start and end are instances of time that define the actual
Gregorian calendar period covered by the values for the time dimension. The algorithm
for computing start and end fields for any supported reporting period is defined
in the SDMX Technical Notes.

These fields should be used only when the component value represents one of the
values for the time dimension.

Values are considered as inclusive both for the start field and the end field.
Values must follow the ISO 8601 syntax for combined dates and times, including time zone.

Example:

    {
        "id": "2010",
        "name": "2010",
        "start": "2010-01-01T00:00Z",
        "end": "2010-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    }

These fields are useful for visualisation tools, when selecting the appropriate point in time for the time axis.
Statistical data, can be collected, for example, at the beginning, the middle or the end of the period, or can
represent the average of observations through the period. Based on this information and using the start and end
fields, it is easy to get or calculate the desired point in time to be used for the time axis.


### Annotations

*Array* *nullable*. Provides a list of annotation objects. Annotations can be attached
to data sets, series and observations.

    "annotations": [
      {
        "title": "Sample annotation",
        "uri": "http://sample.org/annotations/74747"
      }
    ]

Each annotation object contains the following optional information:

#### title

*string* *nullable*. Provides a title for the annotation. Example:

    "title": "Sample annotation"

#### type

*string* *nullable*. Type is used to distinguish between annotations designed to
support various uses. The types are not enumerated, and these can be freely specified by
the creator of the annotations. The definitions and use of annotation types
should be documented by their creator. Example:

    "type": "reference"

#### uri

*string* *nullable*. URI - typically a URL - which points to an external resource
which may contain or supplement the annotation. If a specific behavior is desired,
an annotation type should be defined which specifies the use of this field more exactly.

    "uri": "http://sample.org/annotations/74747"

#### text

*string* *nullable*. Contains the text of the annotation.

    "text": "Sample annotation text"

#### id

*string* *nullable*. ID provides a non-standard identification of an annotation.
It can be used to disambiguate annotations. Example:

    "id": "74747"




## dataSets

An array of data set objects. Example:

    "dataSets": [
      {
        "action": "Information",
        "series": {
          # series object #
        }
      }
    ]

There are between 2 and 3 levels in a data set object, depending on the way the data in the message is organized.

A data set may contain a flat list of observations. In this scenario, we have 2 levels in the data part of the message:
the data set level and the observation level.

A data set may also organize observations in logical groups called series. These groups can represent time series or
cross-sections. In this scenario, we have 3 levels in the data part of the message: the data set level, the
series level and the observation level.

Dimensions and attributes may be attached to any of these 3 levels.

In case the data set is a flat list of observations, observations will be found directly under a data set object. In
case the data set represents time series or cross sections, the observations will be found under the series elements.

### action

*String* *nullable*. Action provides a list of actions, describing the intention of the data transmission
from the sender's side. ```Default value is Information```

* Append - this is an incremental update for an existing data set or the provision of new data or documentation
(attribute values) formerly absent. If any of the supplied data or metadata are already present, it will not replace
these data.

* Replace - data are to be replaced, and may also include additional data to be appended.

* Delete - data are to be deleted.

* Information- data are being exchanged for informational purposes only, and not meant to update a system.

Example:

    "action": "Information"

### reportingBegin

*String* *nullable*. The start of the time period covered by the message. Example:

    "reportingBegin": "2012-05-04"

### reportingEnd

*String* *nullable*. The end of the time period covered by the message. Example:

    "reportingEnd": "2012-06-01"

### validFrom

*String* *nullable*. The validFrom indicates the inclusive start time indicating the validity of the information in the data.

    "validFrom": "2012-01-01T10:00:00Z"

### validTo

*String* *nullable*. The validTo indicates the inclusive end time indicating the validity of the information in the data.

    "validTo": "2013-01-01T10:00:00Z"

### publicationYear

*String* *nullable*. The publicationYear holds the ISO 8601 four-digit year.

    "publicationYear": "2005"

### publicationPeriod

*String* *nullable*. The publicationPeriod specifies the period of publication of the data in terms of whatever
provisioning agreements might be in force (i.e., "2005-Q1" if that is the time of publication for a data set
published on a quarterly basis).

    "publicationPeriod": "2005-Q1"

### annotations

*Array* *nullable*. An optional array of annotation indices for the dataset. Indices refer
back to the array of annotations in the structure field. Example:

    "annotations": [ 3, 42 ]

### attributes

*Array* *nullable*. Collection of [attributes values](#attributes) attached to the data set level. This is typically the case when a
particular attribute always has the same value for the data available in the data message. In order to avoid repetition,
that value can simply be attached at the data set level. Example:

    "attributes": [ 0, null, 0 ]

### observations

*Object* *nullable*. Collection of [observations](#observations) directly attached to a data set. This is the case when
a data set represents a flat collection of observations. In case the observations are organised into logical groups
(time series or cross-sections), use the [series element](#series) instead. Example:

    "observations": {
      "0:1:0": [ 105.6, 0, 1],
      "0:1:1": [ 105,9 ]
    }

### series

*Object* *nullable*. A collection of series. Each series object is identified by a key (a string representing the index of each dimension value, separated by a colon) and contains the observation values and associated attributes, when the observations contained in the data set are used into logical groups (time series or cross-sections). This element must **not** be used in case the data set represents a flat list of observations. Example:

    {
      "annotations": [],
      "attributes": [ 0, 1 ],
      "observations": {
        "0": [ 105.6, null, null ],
        "1": [ 105.9 ],
        "2": [ 106.9 ],
        "3": [ 107.3, 0 ]
      }
    }

#### annotations

*Array* *nullable*. An optional array of annotation indices for the series. Indices refer
back to the array of annotations in the structure field. Example:

    "annotations": [ 3, 42 ]

#### attributes

*Array* *nullable*. Collection of attributes values. Each value is an index to the
*values* array in the respective *Attribute* object. Example:

    "attributes": [ 0, 1 ]

For information on how to handle the attribute values, see the section dedicated to [handling component values](#handling_values).

#### observations

*Object* *nullable*. An object of observation values. Each observation value is an
array of one of more values.

    "observations": {
      "0": [ 105.6, null, null ],
      "1": [ 105.9 ],
      "2": [ 106.9 ],
      "3": [ 107.3, 0 ]
    }

The keys in the observation object are the index values of the observation level dimensions. It's one
for time series and cross-sections, but there will be more than one when the data set represents a flat list of
observations.

The first value in the observation array is the observation value. The data type
for observation value is *Number*. Data type for a reported missing observation value is a *null*.

Elements after the observation value are values for the observation level attributes.



# Handling component values

Let's say that the following message needs to be processed:

```json

    "header": {
        "id": "62b5f19d-f1c9-495d-8446-a3661ed24753",

                        "1": [40.3000, 0]
                    }

There is one data set in the message, and it contains two series.

```json
"0": {
    "attributes": [0],
    "observations": {
        "0": [1.5931, 0],
        "1": [1.5925, 0]
    }
},
"1": {
    "attributes": [1],
    "observations": {
        "0": [40.3426, 0],
        "1": [40.3000, 0]
    }
}
```

The structure.dimensions field tells us that, out of the 6 dimensions, 4 have the same value for the 2 series and are therefore
attached to the data set level.

We see that, for the first series, we get the value 0:

    "0": { ... }

From the structure information, we know that CURRENCY is the series dimension.

```json
"series": [
    {
        "id": "CURRENCY",
        "name": "Currency",
        "keyPosition": 1,
        "values": [
            {
                "id": "NZD",
                "name": "New Zealand dollar"
            }, {
                "id": "RUB",
                "name": "Russian rouble"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

The value 0 identified previously is the index of the item in the collection of values for this component. In this case,
the dimension value is therefore "New Zealand dollar".

The same logic applies when mapping attributes.
